Free Writing is a clean and creative blog theme for writers and bloggers. The theme is responsive. It is fully compatible with mobile phones, desktop computers, and tablets such as iPads. The WordPress theme has a full-width multi-purpose design that is minimal and simple. The readability is optimized through great typography. You can use it as a newspaper or magazine where you post your news about your personal life, food, entertainment, gaming, or anything else. Page builders work fine with the theme, and since it's full width by default, you can create a landing page or one page easily to visualize your business, agency, or consultant company. Since we have made it worthwhile for companies, too, we have, of course, spent a lot of time optimizing the SEO (search engine optimization) and load time, so when your visitors load your site, they will have a great experience. There is also lots of space for ads such as AdSense and other ad programs through a lot of widget opportunities.
